This program manipulates PGM files through modules (utilities) in a number of different ways.

There are 6 main C files that transform the PGM files and a couple of C and H files
to make the whole program more modular, accessible and easy to use.

C files: (main, the programs are executed)
All the main files call functions and test them for possible errors in the PGM file.

Task 1 & 3: pgmEcho.c
Reads in an ASCII/Binary PGM file and outputs (writes), either an ASCII/Binary PGM file.
(ASCII to ASCII, Binary to Binary)

Task 2 & 3: pgmComp.c
Reads in an ASCII/Binary PGM file and compares whether they are logically identical.
(ASCII to ASCII, Binary to Binary, ASCII to Binary)

Task 3: pgma2b.c
Reads in an ASCII PGM file and converts it to a Binary PGM file. 
(ASCII to Binary)

    pgmb2a.c
Reads in a Binary PGM file and converts it to a Binary PGM file. 
(Binary to ASCII)

Task 4: pgmReduce.c
Reads in an ASCII/Binary PGM file, an integer factor n and outputs (writes), 
either an ASCII/Binary PGM file downsized by factor n times. 
(ASCII to ASCII(downsized), Binary to Binary(downsized))

Task 5: pgmTile.c
Reads in an ASCII/Binary PGM file, an integer factor n and outputs (writes), 
either an ASCII/Binary PGM file. The program divides the input file into nxn smaller images. 
(ASCII to ASCII(nxn templates), Binary to Binary(nxn templates))

Task 6: pgmAssemble.c
Reads in an ASCII/Binary PGM file, an integer factor n and outputs (writes), 
either an ASCII/Binary PGM file . The program assembles the input small images into a large image. 
(ASCII to ASCII(assembles), Binary to Binary(assembles))

C & H files: (modularity, error testing and checking, structure)

pgmRead.c
Reads in any ASCII/Binary PGM file and checks for errors.
pgmWrite.c
Writes out any ASCII/Binary PGM file and checks for errors.
pgmImage.h
Makes a standard Image struct to use in all the C files; declares functions 
for all C main files; declares variables for storing the image.
pgmImage.c
Initialises all the variables in the Image struct (made in pgmImage.h) 
to globally be used in all the main C files.
pgmErrors.h
Defines all the error codes.
