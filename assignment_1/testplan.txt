Test plan:

A: For all the error messages and values we have a pgmErrors.h file.
The C files pgmRead.c and pgmWrite.c will both check all the data entering/being outputted in the programming project; test it and only if it passes, the main functions will progress into compilation of the specified task.
pgmRead.c makes all the checks regarding the header data and image data.
Tests are made for: Bad Magic Number, Bad Dimensions, Bad Max Gray Value, Large Comment line, Bad Data, Malloc Allocation.
pgmWrite.c only makes sure the output file works.

B:Inside all the main C files(pgmEcho.c, pgmComp.c, pgma2b.c, pgmb2a.c, pgmReduce.c, pgmTile.c, pgmAssemble.c):
All the main files check if the file exists, how many arguments it has, if it can read and write in a file. Then all the C files use a variable to check if throughout the program, from the Read functions, there are any exit errors. All files check if they are reading an ASCII/Binary file with the magic number being P2/P5.
